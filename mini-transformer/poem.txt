life:
The sun rises beyond the hills with quiet grace.
Each morning brings a promise not yet broken.
Winds whisper truths we often overlook.
Time flows like a silent river in motion.
The heart learns slowly, through joy and pain.
Dreams drift between stars and silent sleep.
Hope carries us when strength is gone.
Words fall like rain on thirsty minds.
In stillness, the soul finds its voice.
And love, once found, never truly fades.

night:
The moon watches over a world in hush.
Shadows stretch their fingers through the trees.
Silence deepens in the arms of darkness.
Dreamers sail on clouds of hidden thoughts.
Lamps flicker like stars on city streets.
Owls whisper secrets to the listening night.
A breath, a pause, the stillness reigns.
The sky wears its blanket of deep velvet blue.
Eyes close beneath soft lullabies of breeze.
And sleep takes hold where time dissolves.

journey:
Each step forward rewrites the past behind.
Footprints fade but meaning stays.
Paths twist and shift like river bends.
The road teaches more than destination.
Maps lie where wonder leads instead.
Patience paves the hardest miles.
Even stones can bloom with moss.
The walk changes the walker within.
Horizons rise with every climb.
And still, the heart beats on toward more.
